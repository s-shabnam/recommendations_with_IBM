# Recommendations with IBM

In this project I analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles.

## Introduction

The goal of the project is to do recommendation of the articles that are most pertinent to a specific user.

In order to determine which articles to show to each user, a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform is performed. Here are the main steps:


I. Exploratory Data Analysis
II. Rank Based Recommendations
III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
IV. Content Based Recommendations
V. Matrix Factorization
